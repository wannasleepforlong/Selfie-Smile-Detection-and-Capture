# Selfie-Smile-Detection-and-Capture
Capture a photo if smile detected in the selfie camera

This projects utilizes cv2 to detect and capture images when user smiles.

I have also added a feature so it only captures a photo after 5 seconds have elapsed, to prevent infinite clicking.

The photos are stored in a directory named  Captures.

Thanks XD
